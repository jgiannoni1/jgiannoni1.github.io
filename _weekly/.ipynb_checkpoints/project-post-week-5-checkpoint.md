### What did you do last week?
Identified 60 differently formatted property appraisal pages to test LLM's with (gpt-5 mini & NuExtract 2.0 2B). Compared different tools for converting the HTML into a more digestible format for LLM's and landed on Jina.ai's Reader API, which converts the raw HTML of the appraisal pages into markdown. It works great for now since my volume is low during testing, but I might switch to Spider cloud or some other method for pre-processing later. 

### What do you plan to do this week?
- Write the functions that I'll use for testing the LLM's and finish out the rest of the testing pipeline so that I can score the results and make a decision.
- Alter my current scraper so that it can navigate effectively to the property appraisal pages - there are pop-ups, new windows, and sometimes differently labeled links that must be clicked on that I"ll need to account for now. 

### Are there any impediments in your way?
None. 

### Reflection on the process you used last week — how can you make the process work better?
I spread the work out over a couple of days during smaller segments, which has proven to yield more success given my schedule. I need to make more use of my trello board as it will help me organize my thoughts and quickly determine the next tasks I need to work on.
