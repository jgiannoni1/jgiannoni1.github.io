### What did you do last week?
Brainstormed ideas. I've been torn between music/audio, the Bible, and real estate / property investment projects.

### What do you plan to do this week?
This week, I finally chose an idea to go with. In the data scraping work that I do for a real estate client, we've had to parse the property information from various county websites in a rigid and unadaptable way. Additionally, once we click on some of the links for the properties, they lead to pages that have varying formats that are difficult to predict. I'd like to make the navigation scripts more dynamic and then use a trained model at the last stage for parsing data. This will lead to a more fault-tolerant scraper that is adaptable and ultimately cost-saving.

### Are there any impediments in your way?
Yes. I don't want to reinvent the wheel if I don't have to, so I first need to identify existing models that might work for the data that we're going after. If no such solution already exists, then I will need to perhaps train my own. Then there's the question of setting up my own locally run hardware (server) or spooling up an EC2 or something. Lots to think over.

### Reflection on the process you used last week — how can you make the process work better?
I waited too long to start thinking things over and had to cram my brainstorming into a couple of days. Moving forward, I need to stretch things out across the week — 15 minutes here, 30 minutes there, etc.
