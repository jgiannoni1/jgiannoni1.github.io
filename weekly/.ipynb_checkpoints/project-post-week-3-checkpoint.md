### What did you do last week?
Spent time working on my project proposal, researching models to use for data parsing, and how to make my scraper run faster and more fault-tolerant.

### What do you plan to do this week?
I will identify a subset of models for testing and try to figure out which one is best in terms of cost as well.

### Are there any impediments in your way?
Not at the moment.

### Reflection on the process you used last week — how can you make the process work better?
Need to spread the work out amongst my days better — little chunks here and there instead of 1–2 hour sessions.
